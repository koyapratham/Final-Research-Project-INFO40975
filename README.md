# Abalone Sex Classification Using PyCaret

## Project Overview

This project focuses on solving a multi-class classification problem using the Abalone dataset. The primary goal is to predict the sex of abalone (Male, Female, or Infant) based on various physical measurements. The project utilizes the PyCaret library, an open-source, automated machine learning tool, to streamline the model selection, training, and evaluation processes.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and comprises physical measurements of abalone, such as length, diameter, height, whole weight, and others. These features serve as the basis for predicting the sex of the abalone.

## Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition**: The dataset is fetched and prepared using the `ucimlrepo` package.
2. **Preprocessing and Setup**: The PyCaret library is used for preprocessing and setting up the machine learning environment.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Various models are trained and evaluated, with Logistic Regression emerging as the top performer.

## Key Findings

- **Logistic Regression Performance**: Among the various models evaluated, Logistic Regression proved to be the most effective, demonstrating high accuracy in classifying the sex of abalone.
- **Automated Machine Learning**: The use of PyCaret substantially reduced the time and effort needed for model selection and evaluation.
